# Wolf TV Website

This is the Github page for the Wolf TV website.

## What is Wolf TV?

Wolf TV is a student produced announcement show owned by PFISD/Weiss High School. The content produced is to allow students, teachers, and staff to know what events are happening around the school. There are even segments, which are "fun" little shows that go onto different topics other than the announcements shown.

## What is the link to the website?

The first released version of the website is [here](https://wolf-tv.herokuapp.com/)!

## When will the website be finished?

Who knows. Hopefully sometime soon before I graduate senior year. Seriously though, it should be very soon, maybe before September.
