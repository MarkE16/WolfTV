# Wolf TV Website

This is the Github page for the Wolf TV website.

## What is Wolf TV?

Wolf TV is a student produced announcement show owned by PFISD/Weiss High School. The content produced is to allow students, teachers, and staff to know what events are happening around the school. There are even segments, which are "fun" little shows that go onto different topics other than the announcements shown.

## What is the link to the website?

The website is currently not finished, and isn't being hosted right now. When it is finished, it will be hosted, and the README will be updated.

## When will the website be finished?

Who knows. Hopefully sometime soon before I graduate senior year.
